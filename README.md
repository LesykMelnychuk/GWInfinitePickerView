# GWInfinitePickerView

The GWInfinitePickerView is an extension of the UIPickerView which makes it endless (like UIDatePicker).

## Usage

The GWInfinitePickerView inherited from UIPickerView, so all you have to do is just change the class of your picker view to the GWInfinitePickerView. All the magic is under the hood, outside it seems to be normal UIPickerView, so you don't have to change your existing UIPickerView, UIPickerViewDataSource and UIPickerViewDelegate implementation. 

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

GWInfinitePickerView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "GWInfinitePickerView"
```
